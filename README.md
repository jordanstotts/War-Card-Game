## Background
The card game "war" is a simple game played with one deck of 52 cards.  The deck is split in two and each of the players gets their half of the cards. Every round will consist of each player flipping over one card at a time. Whoever has the highest valued card wins the round and collects both played cards and returns them to the bottom of their deck (Ace is high). If there is a tie the players will then flip over one more card on top of the previously played card. Whichever player wins that next card collects all four cards played that round. The player to collect all the cards first is the winner!
